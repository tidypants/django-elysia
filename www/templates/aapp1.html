Thank you for getting in touch with me. It is my pleasure to tell you that you may well be  on the verge of something really empowering. Your life, for all intents and purposes is ready  to begin a new course, a Transit Period, and I hope you take advantage. The changes you see take place could be immediate, but you'll never know till you take the next step...
<br>
<br>
Read on my dear, and prepare yourself for this incredible "transit" you may soon embark upon...

  <p>As you know, a time of immense importance - your Transit Period - could be entering into your life as early as Saturday March 23.<br>
      <br>
    It is a time, if navigated properly, of great opportunity and is a time when you will have the ability to FINALLY ATTRACT ABUNDANCE where you feel you are struggling most.</p>
  <p>It is in this time that is fast approaching for you, that you will be able to shake the cloud that may have been covering you and BLOCKING YOU FROM GAINING LUCK AND HAPPINESS, specifically in the areas of LOVE and ABUNDANCE.</p>
  <p>{{ account.first_name }}, you may be feeling this Transit Period right now!</p>
  <p>You made an excellent decision asking me for help, and at the right time it seems, too.</p>
  <p>You see, Transit Periods are an extraordinary combination of things coming together, not least the position and surrounding influences of the most influential heavenly body: Moon</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
  	<div class="box_corner"><img src="/static/images/top.jpg" alt=""></div>
	<div class="box_bg" style="padding-bottom:0px;">
	<p>The numerology character resulting from the date you first contacted me is: 5</p>
	<p>Extroverted, energetic, resourceful and adventurous, you are impatient and hungry for the taste of life! You'll approach many forks along your path, and you'll welcome each change as a new opportunity. Change is the name of the game for you, as is championing freedom. You are a born progressive -- forward-thinking, liberal and super resourceful. You are also active, daring, non-conventional, unpredictable, and attracted by physical senses and indulgences. Pragmatic and opportunistic, you can be very persuasive. You will succeed in any career that calls for energizing power rather than routine.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="box_corner"><img src="/static/images/bottom.jpg" alt=""></div>
  </div>
  <div class="main_contant">
    <p>I will divulge all in a minute, but I must tell you that it is a very special occurrence to realize one may be on the cusp of such an extraordinary period of change.</p>
    <p>You see, by requesting your reading it tells me that you are ready to make a difference in your life and open the path to love and abundance. </p>
    <p>There is an incredible potential inside you - a Life Force - waiting to break free. It KNOWS that its time has come to be released. </p>
    <p>I must tell you though, there could be some not so good news in your future... I will explain that to you shortly as well.</p>
    <p>Again, as promised, your brief yet lovely Mini-Reading has been prepared for you.</p>
    <p>This Free Mini-Reading will paint a clear picture of how your life SHOULD appear by this time in your life's journey, but will not cover the important dates and decisions you will have to make during your coming Transit Period ( Your TRANSIT PERIOD GUIDE TO LUCK AND HAPPINESS will serve as a guiding beacon of light for you during this most auspicious time).</p>
    <p>Although I have spent literally thousands of hours providing personalized guidance to those in need from around the globe (I'll explain more in a bit), what only matters is that your reading helps you, right now!</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that these insights best apply when you are in touch with your TRUE SELF. The one that is apparent in your birth patterns, and the one that is always to be found inside you. If you feel that these revelations may be a bit on the optimistic side, it is because there is something that has been blocking you from reaching this TRUE POTENTIAL - the potential your coming Transit Period will be able to carry you to.<br>
        <br>
      In other words, {{ account.first_name }}, it's possible there has been some "fog" pursuing you practically since childhood, and that you've had one problem after another, especially as far as money is concerned. You know what I'm talking about - the anxiety and suffering you may have had to put up with, as well as your present problems too.<br>
        <br>
      Some opposing influence might create an abnormal block to the way your TRUE SELF should be living, as you will see in your Free Mini-Reading.<br>
        <br>
      But what's most important is that things can change, and more importantly YOU DESERVE to see them change.<br>
        <br>
      I'll explain in more detail shortly, but for now, let's jump right in to the Free Mini-Reading:</p>

Free Mini-Reading for {{ account.first_name }}<br>
<img src="/static/images/line1.jpg" alt=""></h2>
	  <p>You need to find the answers to certain questions that concern you personally, questions you've probably been asking yourself for quite some time. You are involved with the people around you, you're interested in your future, and you look for ways to make your daily life easier.</p>
      <p>Let's start with the main traits that make up your psychological profile, the particularities of your character that are completely exceptional when looked at as a whole (taken separately these traits might seem ordinary, but in your case their combined effect explains much of the meaning of your life): <em>Sense of beauty, love of life, simplicity, intelligence, grounded, ambitious, tenacious, loyal, energetic, warm hearted... and I should also mention Lucky, since luck smiles down on you naturally, and could become totally amazing if you knew how to take advantage of it!</em><br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
  	<div class="box_corner"><img src="/static/images/top.jpg" alt=""></div>
	<div class="box_bg">
	<h3 class="padding"><img src="/static/images/love.jpg" alt="Love - Emotions" title="Love - Emotions" align="left">Love - Emotions</h3>
	<p class="clear">Love plays an important role in your life, and you engage yourself with fervor, wisdom and gratitude. You do a lot to deserve your happiness, and you hope that your significant other is willing to pay you back in kind. You want to see desire and passion in the face of your loved one, and you want to be the only person to benefit. But be careful not to let your sense of possession gain the upper hand, or your passion might turn into destructive jealousy. Jealousy will destroy what your lucky star wants you to build.</p>
	<p>Here is some important advice that might help you: persevere in your intimacy, don't let just anyone into your private life, never discuss your problems with anyone you don't completely trust, and make sure the people around you leave you in peace as far as your affairs of the heart are concerned, since they concern only you.</p>
	<h3><img src="/static/images/social.jpg" alt="Social Life" title="Social Life" align="left">Social Life</h3>
	<p>You have enough personality and magnetism to do without any superior authority. Have faith in yourself, in your ideas and your initiatives. Hold your head high and persevere, and you will move forward without problems, even in the most delicate or hazardous of times.</p>
	<h3><img src="/static/images/luck.jpg" alt="Luck" title="Luck" align="left">Luck</h3>
	<p>Your golden number is 6, your lucky number par excellence. Use the number 6 as often as you can: for example, when you set up an important meeting, insist on the 6th day of the month, or 6 o'clock in the afternoon; when you take a train, get in the 6th car. Use it whenever you play games etc.</p>
	<p>If you have premonitory dreams - and you should! - 6 is your most auspicious number. It's also lucky for travel and in financial matters.</p>
	<p>And 19, your number for happiness, can also be used to combat misfortune. </p>
	<p>Use a combination of these three numbers as often as you can. Luck will do many things for you, and your	intuition will do the rest.</p>

  <!--============Third step start==============-->
    <div id="third_step">

  <div class="main_contant">
<h3>THE DECISION IS YOURS!<br>
<img src="/static/images/line1.jpg" alt=""></h3>
<p>You have the potential for incredible things, which you received at birth (a potential for making the most out of your luck) which is in strong contrast  to the difficult life you are leading, and the bad luck that could be unjustly affecting you at the moment.</p>
  <p>You can easily learn secrets for dealing with the difficulties and financial stresses that follow you.</p>
  <p>Here's why:</p>
  <p>Venus, along with the other planets that affect your Destiny, may endow you with tremendous Lucky Power.</p>
  <p>This should have turned out to be very positive for you in terms of love, and the realization of what you really hold dear in life. But perhaps that has not been the case.</p>
  <p>Of course you've had a few happy moments at certain times in your life. But you may feel that you have generally been lacking in luck in many important areas of your life. Isn't that so?</p>
  <p>You have had some periods of luck and happiness on your journey. But SOMETHING MAY WELL BE PREVENTING YOU FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT LUCK and you feel it has passed you by each time.</p>
  <p>There have undoubtedly also been OPPORTUNITIES FOR GAINS THAT WERE WITHIN YOUR GRASP on many occasions, but perhaps it seems like an invisible hand seems to have prevented you from enjoying your potential success.</p>
  <p>As things stand now you take each day as it comes, without really knowing what will happen to you tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, because of a lack of self-confidence, you may make decisions that eventually have serious consequences.</p>
  <p>You may be thinking that this is all your fault. Well, that is not exactly the case!</p>
  <p>You have everything you need to succeed and it's possible a few unfortunate circumstances affected you, forcing you to make the wrong decisions, those that attract bad luck instead of good luck (especially when it comes to your abundance in life).</p>
  <p>Don't say to yourself: "I've never been lucky... I just have too much bad luck... I'll never get out of my present situation!"</p>
  <p>Believe me, based on my experience I can confidently say that is not the case at all. On the contrary!</p>
  <p>You have a right to happiness. And you should know that there are no unlucky stars in your astral chart. All you have to do is follow THE PATH TO LUCK AND HAPPINESS as indicated by your master planets, which will soon become active and influence your destiny... if you know how to call on them.<br>
      <br>
    It's too bad you didn't request a reading sooner, {{ account.first_name }}. You could be living with all the fortunate events that have passed you by.</p>
  <p>But I'm here to tell you {{ account.first_name }}, that it isn't too late!</p>
  <p>You see, the TRANSIT PERIOD THAT IS FAST APPROACHING is a very unique when the influential bodies that make up your Astral Chart align with one another in such a way that it puts your life on "steroids".</p>
  <p>Have you ever noticed how people never seem to have a consistent amount of "luck"?</p>
  <p>They either talk about how "things haven't been going my way lately"... or ... "I feel like I'm on a lucky streak!"</p>
  <p>Well {{ account.first_name }}, that is because each person's influential bodies are in CONSTANT MOTION, moving in and out of sync with each other. There are so many factors come into play that you can compare it to being put into a maze every couple months.</p>
  <p>Everyone goes through their "astral maze" without knowing which direction to take at each turn. Sometimes they "get lucky" and get quite far in their maze, and other times they work themselves into a corner right away, and they go through a period of bad luck until a "new maze" (a new phase of astral alignments) begins.</p>
  <p>Then, once in a very rare while, one will enter into a MAZE UNLIKE ANY OTHER. As I said, some people are never really discovered this opportunity, but most people will enter into one at significant times in their life.</p>
  <p>The secret key to this maze is found in the meaning of each Transit Period. In fact, this is a time when most people find their true love, get that big promotion, find that dream job or SUDDENLY FIND A SOURCE OF ABUNDANCE that puts them back on their feet - no matter how "far" they get or where they end up in the maze.</p>
  <p>Making it to the end of the maze is very rare and difficult to do, but just by sheer odds there are those few handful of people who do reach the end, and suddenly find themselves LIVING THE LIFE THEY'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF... they've realized their Ultimate Destiny.</p>
  <p>Remember Susan Boyle? She was briefly deprived of oxygen at birth, leaving her with learning disabilities. She was bullied in school - the kids called her "Susie Simple'.</p>
  <p>When her mother passed in 1997, neighbors said that she stayed in the house, not answering the phone or knocks for 3 to 4 days. Up until her sudden fame in 2009, Susan described her life in West Lothian, Scotland as "mundane" and "routine".</p>
  <p>But then, {{ account.first_name }}, things changed for her. She didn't just find true love or get a raise.... she, by sheer stroke of luck, made it to the end. She solved the maze by chance... and received INTERNATIONAL STARDOM, having the top-selling debut album for a female artist of all time. She found her Ultimate Destiny, and has been living it ever since.</p>
  <p>{{ account.first_name }}... if you ask you can have your very own Transit Period Guide to Luck and Happiness prepared just for you. In other words, because your Transit Period is nearly upon us, I can grant you access to a personalized "Transit Period Guide" to show you the path you must take when it comes time to enter YOUR Transit Period - your Maze of Destiny.</p>

  <h5>Here's An Amazing Story!</h5>
    <p>Now, it's easy to share success stories of famous people,  but what about people that aren't so famous? What about people that perhaps  don't have all the luxuries that life can offer... how will this reading help  them?</p>
    <p><strong><u>I want to introduce you to Niki Jensen... </u></strong><img src="/static/images/niki.jpg" alt="Niki" title="Niki" class="niki"></p>
    <p>Niki came to me full of fear and doubt. She was tired,  stressed out and so unsure of what she needed to do to get her life back on  track... As she said to me, “<em>I need help separating what I want and need as  opposed to what others expect of me.”</em></p>
    <p>And I knew exactly what she meant.</p>
    <p>We often become so caught up in trying to please others that  we forget our own needs and desires... we lose sight of our own path and when  we finally “wake up,” we realize that we're no longer moving in a direction  that matches our True Purpose.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, Niki requested her Transit Period Guide and was  able to stop this destructive behavior in its tracks. She wrote me not long  after she received her Guide to express her amazement at its accuracy. </p>
    <p><em>“I was blown away by this reading,” </em>she wrote. <em>“It  very accurately diagnosed the issues of my life that I was concerned about. I'm  going to use my Transit Period Guide as a means of giving me courage, that what  I've been doing and how I've been believing has not often resulted in the life  I want for myself.”</em></p>
    <p><u>And that's exactly what the Guide is meant to do!</u></p>
    <p>As Niki discovered, we're all called to a specific purpose  in life... we're all here for a reason, but so often, we lose sight of that  purpose because we're so entrenched by all the dramas that we encounter every  day.</p>
    <p>Money becomes an obstacle... desires get put on the  backburner so that we can focus on responsibilities and obligations... and  before we know it, we're no longer living the life we want... we're simply  going through the motions, doing what society has told us we're supposed to do.</p>
    <p>But what about happiness and fulfillment?!</p>
    <p>When do those come into play?</p>
    <p>Niki fortunately realized that this detour wasn't what she  truly wanted and was able to find her way back to the path she was truly meant  to travel. </p>
    <p><em>“As I was reading about myself, I began to feel the  wheels start turning and telling me to lose my fears and just take the  plunge... I know have a new way of feeling, seeing and doing things... A fresh  start, a new way of living in harmony with my TRUE self!”</em></p>
    <p>And isn't that exactly what we all want?!</p>
    <p>You can see now why it’s so important to request your own  Transit Period Guide... like Niki Jensen, I know that you've also experienced those  moments where you feel you're headed in the wrong direction...</p>
    <p>Where you realize that what you want and what you're getting  are two very different things and you know that if you had the chance, you'd be  capable of so much more... so many wonderful and amazing things...</p>
    <p><strong>Now is your time, {{ account.first_name }}!</strong></p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="clear"></div>
  <p>But you MUST act fast, {{ account.first_name }}. Please don't "mull it over" and put it off, like so many opportunities you have done so in the past and regretted.</p>
  <p>I will offer this reading at a MUCH REDUCED cost from what I ask from my in-person clients because I know how much you have to gain... but only if you DO NOT SHARE this discounted arrangement with anyone else.</p>
  <p>I extend these full services in this manner to you {{ account.first_name }}, to give you the best advantage possible as you sit on the cusp of your Transit Period.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="main_contant">
  	<h3>BUT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE, {{ account.first_name }}</h3>
	<p>The fact that you came to me just before the beginning of a crucial Transit Period might have been coincidence... but it's likely powers of a HIGHER ASTRAL PLANE have come into play...</p>
    <p>I am sure you have a strong intuition, you're sensitive, and you are very generous, BUT sometimes other people ask too much of you, without knowing that things aren't going so well.</p>

  	<div class="box_corner"><img src="/static/images/top.jpg" alt=""></div>
	<div class="box_bg">
	<h3 class="center" style="font-size:23px;"> HERE'S WHAT YOUR READING CAN DO FOR YOU:</h3>
	<p>Firstly, it's important for you to know that to help you it is not absolutely necessary for us to meet personally.</p>
	<p>I have already helped hundreds of people who, like you, had serious problems with luck or love or money, without my having to meet them face to face.</p>
	<p>Your reading will show you WHAT TO DO TO AVOID PROBLEMS that could arise for you (and how to turn them in your favor).</p>
	<p>You must not ignore this period which could transform. All you have to do to benefit 100% from the opportunities that arise at the start of this lucky period is act in harmony with the times I indicate.</p>
	<p>If you follow the advice given, your situation can improve very rapidly after that.</p>
	<p>But you have to be careful. There are always obstacles you have to avoid. You have to be very discerning about this.</p>
	<p>Bad habit may attract some unlucky trends, which prevent you from following my guidance. If that turns out to be the case, I will tell you exactly what to do to STAY THE COURSE and focused on your progress. <br>
	  I'll also tell you what decisions you have to make (during the times of optimal luck) to ensure that your destiny advances firmly towards the realization of your imminent happiness.</p>
	<p>I am this confident about your immediate future because I have seen countless times how the planetary movements that govern our fortune work in predictable and powerful ways.</p>
	<p>Believe me, it's absolutely essential for you to know what important events will happen for you in the coming months, and I'll be happy to tell you about them.</p>

	<p>Here's what I am offering to do for you:</p>
	<p>The moment I receive your urgent request I will be notified and within just two days send you your TRANSIT PERIOD GUIDE TO LUCK AND HAPPINESS so that the next 12 weeks become the most important in your life.</p>
	<p>What you discover in this detailed reading has nothing in common with anything you may have been told up to now about you and your future.</p>
	<p>You will receive a document that is more complete and more detailed than anything any other spiritual advisor may have done for you before.</p>
	<p>All I can say is that even though you may have unsolved personal problems right at this moment, your immediate future holds several favorable opportunities to overcome them with clarity.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="box_corner"><img src="/static/images/bottom.jpg" alt=""></div>
  </div>
  <div class="main_contant">
    <p>IN THIS COMPLETE, IN-DEPTH AND EYE-OPENING READING you will discover (among other things):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Exactly how to approach your lucky periods during the next 12 weeks (these are the "turns" you must take in order to find ABUNDANCE, LOVE AND LUCK).</li>
	    <li>Which OBSTACLES YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO AVOID (the junctions where, if you take a false step, will take you off course where there is no turning back).</li>
	    <li>Which periods are most favorable for you in the areas that interest you most, including your LUCKY DATES, LOVE, AND IMPORTANT ENCOUNTERS. And that's not all...</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Your reading will also give you specific advice for each precise situation you encounter in your family, and in your relations with other people. I will help you overcome any feelings of solititude, and I will also tell you how you can outsmart the mischievous influence that has been preventing you from accessing the happiness you have every right to enjoy.</p>
    <p>BUT THAT'S NOT ALL, {{ account.first_name }}...</p>
